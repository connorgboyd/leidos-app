            Paving the way for future improvements on WVU's favorite mode of transportation!
            This projectâ€™s purpose is to (hypothetically) record, process, and display the electrical power 
            that the Personal Rapid Transport (PRT) system uses. This is the first of hopefully many similar projects at 
            West Virginia University that will build upon each other and reach a point of consistent PRT monitoring that is easily available
            on a simple user interface. For the scope of this first iteration, this lovely user interface was created to present some previously captured test bed data.
            With options to view the data in both log and graph format, the user interface also has some work-in progress features such as profile features,
            and viewing data by time-frame, that will be more useful when the project is built upon and is active on a wider scale.

            A modular Raspberry Pi 4 Model B microcontroller equipped with a sensor suited to measure the PRT's power is the basis of all
            that is to come. In this first iteration, the focus was on a testbed that lays the foundation for this ultimate goal. A PWM ciruit
            used in conjunction with an ADC on the RPi simulated the RPi collecting analog voltage data. Python programs on the RPi generated
            this data through the PWM circuit, collected the data through the ADC, stored it in a .csv file, and analyzed the contents of that .csv file.
            The results of this program were then saved as assets on the web-based user interface for viewing!
